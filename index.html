            <p>My name is Azadeh Mousavi. I am a PhD candidate at Pennsylvania State University. My primary research focus is on studying flow dynamics and sediment transport, particularly in relation to nature-based solutions (NBS) for river restoration. My research interests include turbulent flow, multiphase flow, non-Newtonian fluid flow, the immersed boundary method, environmental hydrodynamics, and sediment transport. I have been working on understanding turbulent flow since 2016, beginning with my experimental work on flow around flexible vegetation using PIV during my master’s degree at Sharif University of Technology. I continued to work on environmental hydrodynamics and sediment transport around nature-based solutions for river restoration at Penn State’s <a href="https://github.com/psu-efd" target="_blank">PSU_CFD group</a>  through computational and experimental studies..</p>
